	<h1>Welcome to the SpArk</h1>
	<p>After the nuclear outbreak on Earth about 1000 years ago, it became too dangerous to stay there. Giant, mutant creatures took over, mostly bugs. Many died just trying to survive but it was just too difficult. Luckily, there was a light of hope. The government had already made a solution to their problems over the years. After gathering a couple thousand people, the remaning population was ready to leave this place. After loading everybody on board they were ready for take off. They traveled to space in the SpArk, an incredibly large spaceship that could hold all of the survivors. It is still our current home after we had to leave our planet.</p>
	<p>The SpArk has almost everything thing you could need. Food? No problem, there is a farm we crops are grown and animals are raised. We stop by nearby planets and harvest ores and other resources for later use. We also have general services so dont worry about that. We also have buildings for entertainment like movie theaters and clubs so theres always something to do. </p>
