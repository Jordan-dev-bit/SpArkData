	<p>As stated, the SpArk has anything you could possibly need. But lets talk about other events on the ship. We do still celebrate holidays here so look forward to that. The ship also has places to hang out with friends and others. You could imagine the Spark as a space cruise ship except people live and grow up here. There is never a dull moment on the ship.</p>
