	<h1>Enhanced Sense</h1>
	<p>Axel's hidden ability is improved hearing. Sounds basic, but in a job where bugs can sneak up on you its invaluable. Sometimes sight isnt enough to keep track of everything around you so thats where his hearing comes in. According to Axel he doesnt like loud music or sounds. It's too loud for him so he keeps a set of headphones in his coat.</p>
