	<p>Title: Final Project 
Semester/Year: Fall 2020 
Software: AfterEffect 

The artistic inspiration for this project was my fear of bugs. Or rather my war against them. Walking into the kitchen late at night only to be greeted by a large roach you didn’t see wasn’t the best feeling. So I made a hunter that fight giant bugs. I decided to make an animated short since I felt comfortable with it. The video is about my character, Axel, who’s main job is to exterminate these bugs to save the earth. So in the video he is in the process of hunting a bug down with his enhanced hearing to help him. I used After Effects for most of the project, with Photoshop and Illustrator for changing and adding minor things.  I was following the storyboard the entire time so I think I did a good job at that. There are parts that I could have done a better job of animating but I think I did good.</p>
